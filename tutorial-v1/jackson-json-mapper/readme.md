Perfect! I've created comprehensive markdown files for all six categories of Jackson annotations as requested:

1. **Serialization Annotations** - Controls how Java objects are converted to JSON
2. **Deserialization Annotations** - Controls how JSON is converted to Java objects  
3. **Type Handling Annotations** - Manages polymorphic types and custom serializers
4. **Date/Time Annotations** - Formats dates, times, and numbers
5. **Validation & Behavior Annotations** - Controls inclusion, references, and validation
6. **Advanced Annotations** - Dynamic properties, filtering, and schema generation

Each file includes:
- Detailed explanations of each annotation's purpose and usage
- Complete, runnable code examples with realistic scenarios
- Expected JSON input/output for each example
- Progressive complexity from basic to advanced use cases
- Best practices and common patterns
- Error handling and edge cases where applicable

The guides are structured to be practical references that developers can use immediately, with copy-paste ready code examples that demonstrate real-world usage patterns. Each annotation is thoroughly documented with multiple examples showing different aspects and configurations.


I'll provide you with the latest Maven dependencies and Spring Boot configuration for working with Jackson annotations.I've created a comprehensive Spring Boot Jackson setup guide that includes:

---

## Key Components Covered:

### 1. **Latest Maven Dependencies**
- Spring Boot 3.3.1 (latest stable)
- Jackson 2.17.1 (latest version)
- All essential Jackson modules (JSR310, Parameter Names, XML, YAML, CSV, JSON Schema, Hibernate)

### 2. **Configuration Options**
- **Properties/YAML**: Complete application.properties and application.yml configurations
- **Java Config**: Custom ObjectMapper beans with all features
- **Filter Configuration**: Dynamic filtering setup
- **Custom Serializers**: Registration of custom serializers/deserializers

### 3. **Practical Implementation**
- **JPA Entity Models**: Real-world entities with Jackson annotations
- **REST Controllers**: Controllers using filtering and different views
- **Service Layer**: Business logic integration
- **Testing**: Unit test examples with MockMvc

### 4. **Key Features Demonstrated**
- Property naming strategies (snake_case, kebab-case)
- Date/time formatting with JSR310
- Filtering for different user roles (public vs admin views)
- Circular reference handling with JPA entities
- Custom serialization/deserialization
- Validation integration

### 5. **Production-Ready Features**
- Security considerations (password exclusion)
- Performance optimizations
- Error handling
- Transaction management
- Testing strategies

The setup is designed for **Spring Boot 3.x** with **Java 17+** and includes all the latest best practices for Jackson integration. All dependencies are the most recent stable versions as of 2024, and the configuration covers all the annotation types from the previous guides.

You can copy this setup directly into a new Spring Boot project and start using all the Jackson annotations immediately with proper Spring integration.
